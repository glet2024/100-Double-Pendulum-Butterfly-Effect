# 100-Double-Pendulum-Butterfly-Effect
A simulation of 100 double pendulums with very slight differences in initial conditions that tend toward chaos

With guidance from https://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/double_pendulum_animated.html and https://scipython.com/blog/the-double-pendulum/, I created a simulation of 100 double pendulums whose angles between each of the two arms of the pendulum differ by 1 ten-millionth of a degree (or 100 nano-degrees) from the angle of the previous pendulum.
For the first few seconds, the 100 pendulums move in seeming unison, but the slight difference in their starting angle measure is magnified over time, and demonstrates a system tending toward chaos/disorder!
